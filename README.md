# NDVI-time-series-analysis

Using satellite images as input we created a time series image stack which was processed/filtered 
and analyzed to obtain sowing and harvesting periods of crops in our region of interest.
The types of crop(Kharif, Rabi and zaid) were also derived from the graphs by analyzing 
crop cycles in a specific time period.
